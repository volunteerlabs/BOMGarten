# BOMGarten (ALPHA)

## THIS TOOL IS IN AN ALPHA STAGE AND IS NOT RECOMMENED FOR PRODUCTION USE

BOMGarten is a KiCAD Bill of Materials Management and Scraper Tool.

This tool provides a GUI interface to more easily manage a Bill of Materials (BOM) in KiCAD. It is written in Python using WxGlade.

The major advantage of this tool is that it saves part data as part of the KiCAD project itself. This allows a user to specify parts and not have to manually manage a Bill of Materials when schematics are modified or new symbols are added. BOMGarten also has features that allow a user to paste in a part number and scrape part vendors for data when making BOMs and also outputs CSV spreadsheets for eventual purchasing.

Currently, BOMGarten is a standalone tool. As such it is recommended that this tool only be used when the KiCAD project being modified is not also in use by KiCAD.
